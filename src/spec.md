# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add search and sort functionality to the media grid.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a search input field above the media grid that filters media entries by title in real-time
- Add a sort dropdown with options: Title (A-Z), Title (Z-A), Rating (Highest First), Rating (Lowest First), and Recently Added
- Ensure search and sort work together (search filters, then sort orders the filtered results)

**User-visible outcome:** Users can search for media by title and sort the media grid by title, rating, or date added to quickly find and organize their media collection.
