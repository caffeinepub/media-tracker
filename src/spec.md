# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix critical issues and verify functionality of the media tracker application.

**Planned changes:**
- Investigate and resolve runtime errors, broken functionality, and visual issues
- Verify search functionality filters media entries by title correctly
- Verify sort functionality orders entries by title (A-Z/Z-A), rating (high/low), and recently added
- Ensure all CRUD operations work as expected
- Fix any console errors preventing proper application loading

**User-visible outcome:** Users can reliably interact with the media tracker without encountering errors, and search/sort features work correctly to organize their media entries.
