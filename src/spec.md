# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a media tracking application where users can log movies, TV shows, and video games with ratings and reviews, and share their lists with friends.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement backend data model for media entries (title, type, rating, review, date, owner)
- Create CRUD operations for media entries with user authentication
- Build sharing system to generate shareable links for read-only list access
- Design frontend interface displaying media list with cards showing title, type, rating, and review
- Create add/edit form with type selector, rating input, and review text area
- Implement visual rating bar component for each entry
- Add sharing UI to generate and copy shareable links
- Integrate Internet Identity for user authentication
- Apply warm cinematic visual theme with burgundy, gold, and charcoal color palette

**User-visible outcome:** Users can log in with Internet Identity, track their watched movies/shows/games with ratings and reviews, view their collection in an elegant interface with visual rating indicators, and share their list via link with friends who can view it in read-only mode.
