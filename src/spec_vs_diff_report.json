  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 (search input) and REQ-2 (sort dropdown) in the Dashboard component. Search filtering by title (case-insensitive) and real-time updates are present. Sort options include all five required choices with 'recently-added' as default. The implementation correctly filters first, then sorts the filtered results.",

      "reason": "The searchQuery state is local to the Dashboard component with no persistence mechanism (localStorage, URL params, etc.). Search state will be lost on refresh or navigation.",
